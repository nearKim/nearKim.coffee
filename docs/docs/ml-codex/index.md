# Machine Learning Codex

A comprehensive guide to machine learning and deep learning, from mathematical foundations to production implementations.

## Structure

Each topic follows a **3-page format**:

1. **Overview** - Intuitive concepts with rigorous mathematical proofs (expandable)
2. **Problems** - Exam-style questions with detailed solutions
3. **Implementation** - Code from scratch (vanilla Python, NumPy, scikit-learn/PyTorch)
