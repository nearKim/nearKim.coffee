# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors - Overview

## Introduction

Overview of eigenvalue theory, diagonalization, and applications to difference and differential equations.

## Key Concepts

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Definition: Av = λv
- Characteristic polynomial
- Computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors

### Diagonalization
- When is a matrix diagonalizable?
- A = PDP⁻¹
- Applications to computing Aᵏ

### Applications
- Powers of matrices and difference equations
- Matrix exponentials eᴬᵗ
- Solving differential equations
- Complex eigenvalues and matrices

### Similarity Transformations
- Similar matrices have same eigenvalues
- Change of basis interpretation
