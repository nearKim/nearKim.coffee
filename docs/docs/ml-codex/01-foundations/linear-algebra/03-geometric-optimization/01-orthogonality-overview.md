# Orthogonality - Overview

## Introduction

Overview of orthogonal vectors, projections, least squares, and the Gram-Schmidt process.

## Key Concepts

### Orthogonal Vectors and Subspaces
- Definition: v · w = 0
- Orthogonal complements
- Orthogonal bases
- Pythagorean theorem

### Projections
- Projection onto a line
- Projection onto a subspace
- Projection matrix P = A(AᵀA)⁻¹Aᵀ
- Properties: P² = P, Pᵀ = P

### Least Squares
- Solving Ax = b when no exact solution exists
- Normal equations: AᵀAx̂ = Aᵀb
- Applications to data fitting

### Gram-Schmidt Process
- Orthogonalizing a basis
- QR decomposition
- Modified Gram-Schmidt for stability

### Fast Fourier Transform
- Orthogonal basis of complex exponentials
- FFT algorithm
- Applications to signal processing

## Applications

- Linear regression
- Data fitting
- Computer graphics
- Signal processing
