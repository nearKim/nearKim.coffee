# Optimization Methods - Deep Dive

## Mathematical Foundations

Rigorous treatment of optimization in linear algebra.

## Optimization Theory

### Critical Points

**Theorem**: If f is differentiable and x* is a local minimum, then ∇f(x*) = 0

**Proof**: (To be completed)

### Second Derivative Test

**Theorem**: For f(x) = ½xᵀAx - bᵀx:
