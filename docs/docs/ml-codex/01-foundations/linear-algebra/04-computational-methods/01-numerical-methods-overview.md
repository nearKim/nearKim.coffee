# Numerical Methods - Overview

## Introduction

Overview of computational aspects of linear algebra: norms, conditioning, and iterative methods.

## Key Concepts

### Matrix Norms
- Vector norms: ||x||₁, ||x||₂, ||x||∞
- Matrix norms
- Induced norms
- Frobenius norm

### Condition Numbers
- κ(A) = ||A|| ||A⁻¹||
- Ill-conditioned vs well-conditioned matrices
- Impact on numerical accuracy
- Relationship to eigenvalues

### Eigenvalue Computation
- Power method
- QR algorithm
- Jacobi method
- Applications to large-scale problems

### Iterative Methods
- Jacobi iteration
- Gauss-Seidel
- Conjugate gradient
- When to use iterative vs direct methods

## Applications

- Large-scale linear systems
- Sparse matrices
- Machine learning optimization
- Scientific computing
