# Linear Programming - Overview

## Introduction

Overview of linear programming, the simplex method, duality, and applications to networks and game theory.

## Key Concepts

### Linear Programming
- Standard form: minimize cᵀx subject to Ax = b, x ≥ 0
- Feasible region
- Basic feasible solutions
- Optimal vertices

### The Simplex Method
- Moving between vertices
- Pivot operations
- Tableau method
- Degeneracy

### Duality Theory
- Primal and dual problems
- Weak and strong duality theorems
- Complementary slackness
- Economic interpretation

### Network Models
- Max flow problems
- Min cost flow
- Assignment problems
- Connection to graph theory

### Game Theory
- Zero-sum games
- Mixed strategies
- Nash equilibrium
- LP formulation

## Applications

- Resource allocation
- Supply chain optimization
- Network routing
- Strategic decision making
