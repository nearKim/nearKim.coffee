# Linear Transformations - Overview

## Introduction

High-level overview of linear transformations, their properties, and relationship to matrices.

## Key Concepts

### Definition
- What is a linear transformation?
- Linearity properties: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cv) = cT(v)

### Matrix Representation
- Every linear transformation can be represented as a matrix
- Change of basis

### Kernel and Image
- Kernel (null space) of T
- Image (range) of T
- Rank-nullity theorem

### Special Transformations
- Projections
- Rotations
- Reflections

## Applications

- Computer graphics
- Data transformations
- Function spaces
